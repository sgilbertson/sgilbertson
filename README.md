# 👋 Hi, I’m @sgilbertson
## 👀 I’m interested in ...

Many hobbies:

* Photography 
* Electronics
* 3d printing
* Just getting into cnc, bought a Genmitsu 3018 pro
* Software development, and since that's my day job it takes a lot of time away from the others.

Also I am not that far away from retirement, whereupon I'll probably add some more.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

* How to fit the 3018 CNC into my life.
* Practical uses for the Cricut Maker, and how
to combine that with other fabrication equipment (3d printer, CNC)
* Programming-wise, new stuff every day, so there's no point trying to document that.

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

Nothing at the moment.

## 📫 How to reach me ...

Here, I suppose.
